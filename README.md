# SNAKE GAME
The snake game is a simple and popular arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around on a game board. The objective is to guide the snake to eat food and grow longer without colliding with the walls or its own body.

In the JavaScript implementation, we create a canvas element on which the game is displayed. The snake is represented as a series of connected squares or segments, and the food is represented as a single square. The player controls the snake's movement using the arrow keys.

The game starts with the snake positioned at a specific location on the game board. As the game begins, the snake starts moving in a specific direction (usually initially towards the right). The player can change the snake's direction by pressing the arrow keys, which updates the direction of movement.

The snake continuously moves in the chosen direction, and the player's objective is to guide the snake to the food. When the snake's head comes in contact with the food, it "eats" it, and its length increases by one segment. The food then reappears at a random location on the game board.

The player needs to avoid collisions between the snake's head and its body or the walls of the game board. If the snake collides with any of these, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed. The score is typically based on the length of the snake.

To implement the game, we use JavaScript to handle the logic for updating the snake's position, checking for collisions, generating random food positions, and updating the score. We also handle the keyboard events to control the snake's movement.

Overall, the snake game is a fun and challenging implementation that requires quick thinking and precise control to avoid collisions and achieve a high score. It is a classic example of a simple game that can be implemented using JavaScript and HTML canvas.
